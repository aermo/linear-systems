Linear systems
==============

Some of my work with numerical methods for solving linear systems with Clojure.

Functions rely on basic Clojure collection notation. Matrices are represented as vectors of row vectors.

I have tried to create as efficient functions as possible but there is still lot to do. Especially with the representation.

### Functions
- Matrix multiplication
- Matric-vector multiplication
- Gaussian elimination
- Backward substitution
- LU-factorization
- LU forward substitution
- Cholesky decomposition (Cholesky-Banachiewicz)
